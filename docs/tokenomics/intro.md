> Disclaimer: The Tokenomics are on a very early development phase. Everything on this page is just an proposal and should be discussed by the community. 

IOTABOTS was the first project which launched Profile Picture Non-Fungible Tokens (PFP NFTs) on the public IOTA Smart Contracts EVM Testnet. IOTA Smart Contracts allows IOTABOTS the ability to trade, play and earn and enables developers to build their own applications and games. The IOTABOTS ecosystem consists of decentral applications (dApps) like the NFT Plattform, the Gamecenter, the Community NFT Marketplace and many more. This document describes another crucial part of the ecosystem - the Tokenomics.

## Double Token Model
We will introduce a double token model with two different tokens and functionalities. Our goal with $BOLTS and $SCREWS is to incentive users to participate in our and the IOTA ecosystem in a whole. The mechanisms described above includes 2 main goals:

- To reward players for participate on events or contribute on code and content.
- To decentralize the ownership and governance.

## Why 2 Tokens Model?

To ensure the sustainability & scalability of the ecosystem.

## Token Supply

| Token Name | Total Supply |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| $BOLTS     | tba          |
| $SCREWS    | unlimited    |

## $SCREWS
$SCREWS primary function is to incentivize people to build applications and tools for the ecosystem. They can be earned by playing games, on interaction with NFTs, or by solving tasks. There's currently no hard cap on the supply of the $SCREWS token, making it an inflationary token.

### Minting $SCREWS Tokens
Each IOTABOT can mint $SCREWS tokens each day for their owner. How many tokens will determined by the IOTABOT level while minting. The base minting value is 10 Tokens and gets multiplied by the level. The owner must harvest the tokens each day manually.

Examples:
- IOTABOTS Level 1 can mint 10 $SCREWS tokens each day.
- IOTABOTS Level 10 can mint 100 $SCREWS tokens each day.
- IOTABOTS Level 100 can mint 1000 $SCREWS tokens each day.

> A maximal Level for an IOTABOT is not defined yet - the base value and the level factor will be tested in the alpha phase and will change in the future.

### IOTABOT level Up
The IOTABOT level can be increased by one in the Headquarter after 24 hours of training. That means, you need to send the IOTABOT to the Headquarter and he gets a level up each day until you return it. The IOTABOT will mint new tokens for the headquarter in this time and be stored in the headquarter's treasury. The IOTABOTS in the headquarter can by returned anytime and you can profit from the new strenght of your IOTABOT.

### The Headquarter's Treasury
The IOTABOTs in the headquarter will also mint tokens each day for the  headquarter's treasury. The treasury will be used for different things wich will be further discussed with the community. 

Examples:
- Distribute to selected partner treasuries, for example ConentCreatorDAO or DeveloperDAO.
- Buy NFTs on NFT marketplaces (Automated NFT Market Maker).
- Buy $BOlT Tokens and add them to the Liquidity Pools on Decentral Exchanges (DEX).

## $BOLTS
$BOLTS is the governance token for the IOTABOTS Metaverse. It's primary function is to get their holders voting rights on key decisions which will be integrated into IOTABOTS ecosystem, to prove better experience and income for users and token holders.
