> Disclaimer: The Tokenomics are on a very early development phase. Everything on this page is just an proposal and should be discussed by the community. 

IOTABOTS was the first project which launched Profile Picture Non-Fungible Tokens (PFP NFTs) on the public IOTA Smart Contracts EVM Testnet. IOTA Smart Contracts allows IOTABOTS the ability to trade, play and earn and enables developers to build their own applications and games. The IOTABOTS ecosystem consists of decentral applications (dApps) like the NFT Plattform, the Gamecenter, the Community NFT Marketplace and many more. This document describes another crucial part of the ecosystem - the Tokenomics.

## Double Token Model
We will introduce a double token model with two different tokens and functionalities. Our goal with $BOLTS and $SCREWS is to incentive users to participate in our and the IOTA ecosystem in a whole. The mechanisms described above includes 2 main goals:

- To reward players for participate on events or contribute on code and content.
- To decentralize the ownership and governance.

## Why 2 Tokens Model?

To ensure the sustainability & scalability of the ecosystem.

## Token Supply

| Token Name | Total Supply |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| $BOLTS     | tba          |
| $SCREWS    | unlimited    |

## $SCREWS
$SCREWS primary function is to incentivize people to build applications and tools for the ecosystem. They can be earned by playing games, on interaction with NFTs, or by solving tasks. There's currently no hard cap on the supply of the $SCREWS token, making it an inflationary token.

### Earn
#### IOTABOT NFT TCG
- Duel: The Winner in a duel will get a certain $SCREWS reward.

#### PFP NFTs (IOTABOTS and SOONABOTS)
- Mission: After completing daily missions, you will receive $SCREWS rewards.


## $BOLTS
$BOLTS is the governance token for the IOTABOTS Metaverse. It's primary function is to get their holders voting rights on key decisions which will be integrated into IOTABOTS ecosystem, to prove better experience and income for users and token holders.

### Distribution
