title: What is IOTABOTS?
---

> IOTABOTS was the first PFP NFT project on IOTA

A profile picture, or PFP for short can be used in any social media - and IOTABOTS are free to use for that!

The non-fungible token (NFT) is a standard ERC721 token and was deployed on the public IOTA Smart Contracts EVM tesnet.
 
The first drop was on the second of November 2021, where 500 IOTABOTS were minted for free, followed by a second drop on the 10th of November 2021.

In total, 1038 IOTABOTS have been minted. (excluding the one-off giveaways)

There also have been 1001 SPACEBOTS dropped, which are simple unique games.

A new type of bots, SOONABOTS are currently designed and will be distributed through the SOONAVERSE Marketplace.

In the future, BOTS NFTs will give [special privileges](https://twitter.com/iotabots/status/1498614525108490242) (yet to be determined) to their holders.
